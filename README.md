# DataStructure-Implementation-using-Swing

A Java project developed using Swing that implements custom data structures, including Array, Stack, Queue, Circular Queue, and Linked List, with GUI-based interactions. Each data structure offers various operations to manage and manipulate data.

## Features

The project includes the following data structures and their operations:

### 1. Array
- Insert: Add an element at a specified index.
- Delete: Remove an element from a specified index.
- Display: Show all elements in the array.

### 2. Stack
- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove the element at the top of the stack.
- Display: Show all elements in the stack.

### 3. Queue
- Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove the element at the front of the queue.
- Display: Show all elements in the queue.

### 4. Circular Queue
- Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the circular queue.
- Dequeue: Remove the element at the front of the circular queue.
- Display: Show all elements in the circular queue.

### 5. Linked List
- Insert First: Add an element to the beginning of the linked list.
- Insert Last: Add an element to the end of the linked list.
- Delete First: Remove the first element in the linked list.
- Delete Last: Remove the last element in the linked list.

## Technologies Used
- Java: Core language used for implementing data structures and logic.
- Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
